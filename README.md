The solution is to build a reactive conduct communication pipeline using Akka Actors. Inspired by nature and Shakespearean theater, the Akka actor model provides a robust framework for distributed systems. Similar to a beehive, each actor (bee) has a specific role, operating efficiently in parallel. Millions of lightweight actors can run within a single JVM, resembling an army of tiny warriors. Drawing from Erlang, Akka emphasizes high concurrency and fault tolerance. Actors can dynamically change behavior at runtime (hot swapping) and are supervised hierarchically for robust error handling. With features like persistent memory and cluster sharding, Akka actors are both resilient and flexible.
