### Project Overview: Reactive Data Pipeline for Unstructured Communication Data

#### Project Objective
The project aims to develop a reactive data pipeline to handle unstructured data, specifically focusing on communication within the firm. This pipeline will extract relevant communication metadata for monitoring purposes and store it appropriately. Given the diverse and voluminous nature of the data, the solution will leverage the Akka framework to ensure high concurrency, resilience, fault tolerance, and responsiveness.

#### Project Scope
- **Data Variety and Volume**: The firm uses up to 100 different communication channels, generating approximately 25 million communications daily. The data pipeline must accommodate this variety and volume efficiently.
- **Reactive System**: The solution will be built using the actor model in the Akka framework, which is known for its ability to handle high concurrency and provide robustness and responsiveness.
  
#### Business Value
- **Short-term Goals**: 
  - Gain insights into communication flow within the firm.
  - Segregate data feeds to reduce the volume sent to external vendors for compliance, optimizing operational costs.
  
- **Long-term Goals**:
  - Develop an in-house system for managing communication flow, reducing dependency on external vendors.
  - Implement a filtering mechanism to monitor and analyze communication data internally, enhancing the firm's ability to perform real-time analytics and improve decision-making processes.

#### Challenges
- **Data Variety**: The pipeline must be capable of handling diverse formats and structures of communication data from various channels.
- **Data Volume**: The system must be scalable to process the high volume of communications efficiently, ensuring minimal latency and high throughput.
- **Concurrency and Resilience**: Leveraging the actor model in Akka will help achieve high concurrency and resilience, essential for processing millions of communications daily without downtime or performance degradation.

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Data Ingestion**: Implement connectors for the 100 different communication channels to ingest data into the pipeline.
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Develop modules to extract relevant metadata from the communication data for monitoring.
3. **Data Storage**: Utilize appropriate storage solutions to persist the extracted metadata, ensuring scalability and quick retrieval.
4. **Reactive Architecture**: Use the Akka framework to build a reactive system that can handle the high concurrency and provide the necessary fault tolerance and responsiveness.
5. **Analytics Layer**: Create a layer for in-house analytics to monitor and analyze the communication flow, providing actionable insights and improving compliance measures.

#### Metrics
The initial phase of the project focused on processing emails in the RFC822 message format. A series of actors was created to pull emails from a directory, process them, and store the results in S3 object storage.

- **Testing Environment**: QA (Quality Assurance)
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Data Volume**: Approximately 1 million email objects processed

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Processing Throughput**: 
  - **Test Batch**: 120,000 email files
  - **Processing Time**: 18-20 minutes
  
These metrics indicate that the pipeline can process around 6,000 to 6,667 emails per minute on average.

**Analysis of Results**:
- **Scalability**: The pipeline demonstrated the ability to handle a significant volume of emails in a relatively short time, suggesting good scalability potential.
- **Efficiency**: The average processing time of 6,000 to 6,667 emails per minute indicates efficient data handling and storage capabilities, essential for managing the firm's large communication volumes.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Extend the Pipeline**: Expand the data pipeline to support additional communication channels beyond emails.
2. **Optimize Performance**: Continue to optimize the actor model and processing logic to further reduce processing times and increase throughput.
3. **Monitor and Analyze**: Implement monitoring tools to continuously analyze pipeline performance and identify areas for improvement.
4. **Scale Testing**: Gradually increase the volume of data processed during testing to ensure the system remains robust and performant as data loads grow.

5. Recovery Strategies
In addition to building the data pipeline, a robust recovery mechanism has been implemented. Using persistent actors, the system keeps track of pending email files. This ensures that if an actor or the JVM crashes, the system can recover and reprocess the pending files without data loss. This enhances the fault tolerance and reliability of the pipeline, ensuring continuous and accurate data processing even in the face of failures.

#### Conclusion
This project aims to build a robust and scalable reactive data pipeline using the Akka framework, tailored to handle the firm's diverse and voluminous communication data. By achieving the outlined short-term and long-term business goals, the firm will enhance its communication monitoring capabilities and reduce reliance on external vendors, ultimately leading to improved operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making. The initial implementation and testing have shown promising results, setting a strong foundation for future enhancements and scalability.
